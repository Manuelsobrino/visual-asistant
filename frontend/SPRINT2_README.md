# Sprint 2: Voice-First Mobile App - Completed

## Overview
Sprint 2 implementation is complete! We've built a voice-activated mobile app with:
- TensorFlow.js initialized and ready for object detection
- Voice announcements for all interactions
- Hardware button simulation (triggers every 10 seconds)
- Continuous camera capture running in background
- No visual UI for end users (minimal debug UI for development)

## Running the App

1. **Start Expo:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Run on Device/Emulator:**
   - Scan the QR code with Expo Go app on your phone
   - Or press 'a' for Android emulator
   - Or press 'i' for iOS simulator

## What to Expect

1. **On Launch:**
   - App will announce: "Initializing visual assistant, please wait."
   - Grant camera and microphone permissions when prompted
   - App will announce: "Visual Assistant ready. Press volume button to activate."

2. **Every 10 seconds:**
   - Simulated button press triggers
   - App announces: "Listening..."
   - Then: "Processing image..."
   - Finally: "I can see the room. Press volume button again to scan."

## Key Features Implemented
- ✅ Expo app with TypeScript
- ✅ TensorFlow.js initialization
- ✅ Camera permissions and continuous capture
- ✅ Voice announcements for all interactions
- ✅ Simulated hardware button detection
- ✅ No visual UI (voice-first design)
- ✅ Debug info overlay for development

## Notes
- Hardware button simulation triggers every 10 seconds for demo purposes
- Actual object detection will be implemented in Sprint 3
- The app is currently running at http://localhost:8081

## Next Steps
Sprint 3 will add:
- Actual object detection using TensorFlow.js
- Visual bounding boxes for demo presentation
- Real-time object announcements
